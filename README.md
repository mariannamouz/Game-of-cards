# Game-of-cards
A game of cards in which the players score points by matching pairs of cards with the same number.
In the beginning of the game , you choose a number of players and a difficulty level.
On a playerâ€™s turn, they select any two cards from the grid and turn them face up.
If the two revealed cards form a matching pair (i.e., they have the same number, such as 4 of Hearts and 4 of Spades), the player scores one point. The matching cards are then removed from the grid.
If the cards do not match, they are turned back face down, and the turn passes to the next player.
